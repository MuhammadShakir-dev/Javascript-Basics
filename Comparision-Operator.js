/* Not Equal Comparison Operators */
let x = 82;
let y = 12;
console.log(x != y);

/* Not Equal value or not equal type Comparison Operators */
let x = 22;
let y = 23;
console.log(x !== y);

/* Greater Than Comparison Operators */
let x = 2;
let y = 3;
console.log( x > y);

/* Less Than Comparison Operators */
let x = 2;
let y = 3;
console.log( x < y);

/* Greater Than or Equal To Comparison Operators */
let x = 2;
let y = 3;
console.log( x >= y);

 /* Less Than or Equal To Comparison Operators */
