// if you want to print out some specific values from array then use slice.
//  slice has two parameters slice(start,end)
// let's practice it. here i want to print out shakir, rehan, and saad so i give a starting point to it which is from index-1 and an ending point which
// is index-4

let ary = ["Hais","Shakir","Rehan","Saad","Wajid"];
let f_ary = ary.slice(1,4);
console.log(f_ary);

//  if you don't want to add new values in the starting or at the ending of your array then use splice.
