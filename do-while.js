// do while loop works same as while loop but it  1 directly comes inside the loop and print the statment and from the second time it checkes the condition.

// print talble of 2 using while loop.

let start =  0;
do{
    console.log(start);
    start = start + 2;
}while(start <= 20);

// print the reverse if table two

let a = 20;
do{
    console.log(a);
    a = a - 2;
}while(a >= 1);
